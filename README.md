# Domino Project

The Domino Project is a Java application that simulates a game of domino where three bots play against each other.

## Features

- The project simulates a game of domino with three bots.
- To create a bot, simply extend the abstract class `Player` and implement the logic in the `play(...)` function.
- Open the application, and the project starts automatically.
- At the end of the game, the name of the winning player is displayed.
- The game uses Java 11 and no other libraries.
- Note that the project still requires several optimizations and possible improvements.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the project.
3. The game will start automatically, and the bots will play against each other.
4. At the end of the game, the name of the winning player will be displayed.

## Development

- Java 11 is required to compile and run the project.
- To create a new bot, extend the `Player` abstract class and implement the logic in the `play(...)` function.
- Contributions and improvements are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.

## Future Improvements

- Optimization of the game logic.
- Enhanced user interface.
- Support for multiplayer mode.
- Bug fixes and performance enhancements.
